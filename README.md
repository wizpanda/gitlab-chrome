# GitLab Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome browser extension to provide the following changes in the [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) UI:

1. Expands the Merge Request view to utilize the complete available width.
2. Make the code to not wrap in Merge Request.

## Hope

We are hoping that GitLab will provide these as a feature.
